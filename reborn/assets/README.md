# Assets Folder

This folder contains all 3D models and assets for the level editor.

## Folder Structure

- **props/** - Props and decorative objects (crates, barrels, rocks, trees, etc.)
- **buildings/** - Building models and structures (walls, doors, windows, etc.)

## Instructions

1. **Dump all your .glb files here** - Just drag and drop your asset files into the appropriate folder
2. **I'll organize them later** - Once you've added your assets, I'll categorize them properly
3. **Naming convention** - Try to name files descriptively (e.g., `crate_wooden.glb`, `barrel_metal.glb`, `wall_concrete.glb`)

## Supported Formats

- **.glb** files (recommended)
- **.gltf** files

All assets will be automatically integrated into the level editor once organized!
